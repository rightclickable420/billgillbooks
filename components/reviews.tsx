      "Terrence by Bill Gill is the kind of book that stays with you long after you finish. Dark, disturbing, and brilliantly written, it dives deep into the psychology of a killer while weaving a story that's both gripping and thought-provoking. From the chilling detail of Terrence's 'artwork' to the small-town Wisconsin backdrop, every scene feels vivid and real. Fans of true crime, psychological thrillers, and shows like Mindhunter will be hooked from page one. I couldn't put it down, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a smart, chilling, and unforgettable read. Easily one of the best books I've read this year.",
